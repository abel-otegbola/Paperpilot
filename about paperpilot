## Inspiration
The inspiration behind paperpilot stems from personal and observed experiences. We have witnessed the challenges researchers face in finding relevant papers and the time-consuming process of manual searching. This motivated us to leverage the power of Google NLP to streamline research, provide personalized recommendations, and empower users in their quest for knowledge. We believe that by harnessing advanced AI technology, we can revolutionize the research experience, foster collaboration, and unlock new possibilities for discovery and innovation.

## What it does
The website utilizes Google Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide personalized research paper recommendations. By analyzing user preferences and research interests, the platform delivers highly relevant and accurate suggestions, streamlining the process of finding scholarly papers. It empowers users to discover new knowledge, enhance their research efficiency, and foster collaboration within the academic community.

## How we built it
The website was built starting with user interface (UI) design iterations. The development phase involved implementing cutting-edge technologies, integrating Google Natural Language Processing (NLP), and ensuring seamless functionality. Rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures were conducted to ensure a smooth user experience and the highest standards of performance, security, and reliability.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we encountered was ensuring the quality and coverage of the research paper database. Curating and maintaining a comprehensive collection of scholarly resources required overcoming obstacles such as data inconsistencies, incomplete metadata, and varying publication formats. Addressing these challenges involved implementing rigorous data validation processes and using of diverse research paper APIs.
